#### Math - Graph (2020-3-18)
{% include tag_list.html tags=page.tags  %}

Here is a way that you can interact with family &amp; friends and gather data and have your children create a bar graph with that data.

## What you need
* A way to contact people (email, text messages, etc)
* Blank paper where you can create your graph or print ours [link here](tbd)
* A way to color your bar graph

## Step 1

  ### Send out text messages

  Create some group texts, explain what you are doing and your friends &amp; family will be glad to respond and have something positive to help with in their lives.

### Wait for responses 

  We had our daugther respond back via text message which allowed her to practice some writing.  While waiting you can also print out the graph and gather some markers or whatever you want to use.

## Step 2
