[LUNCH DOODLES with Mo Willems! Episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmzjCPQv3y8)

LUNCH DOODLES with Mo Willems!

Kennedy Center Education Artist-in-Residence at Home

Visit http://www.kennedy-center.org/mowillems to download a worksheet for this LUNCH DOODLE!

Episode One: Welcome to Mo’s Studio!
In his first LUNCH DOODLE, Mo welcomes you into his studio at home and guides you through drawing activities using one of his favorite characters as inspiration!

Send the Kennedy Center your drawings and questions for Mo for possible inclusion in the next episode of LUNCH DOODLES!  Kids: work with your parents to email us at: LUNCHDOODLES@kennedy-center.org.

A note from Mo with more about the project:
When I became the Kennedy Center Education Artist-in-Residence, I didn’t realize the most impactful word in that title would be ‘Residence.’ 
With millions of learners attempting to grow and educate themselves in new circumstances, I have decided to invite everyone into my studio once a day for the next few weeks.

Grab some paper and pencils, pens, or crayons.  We are going to doodle together and explore ways of writing and making.

If you have questions for me, send them to LUNCHDOODLES@kennedy-center.org and I might get to answer them.

You might be isolated, but you’re not alone.  You are an art maker.  Let’s make some together.

I’ll see you at 1pm ET weekdays for LUNCH DOODLES and I hope you’ll keep making art even after my visit!
